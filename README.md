## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Though this exercise seems simple, I learnt some important things while creating the solution
1. How to overlay an icon over an image
2. How to align small icons and text next to it.
3. Learn how to use flexbox for layout of items in a row and spacing where required.


### Continued development

I want to learn responsive techniques without using many media queries.
I want to learn how to center things on the screen in a modern way.
I also want to learn the correct way of overlays.
